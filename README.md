# 🏠 Mumbai House Price Prediction

This is a machine learning project which aims to predict housing prices in Mumbai based on several independent features such as area, location, and number of bedrooms (BHK) etc. The dataset is preprocessed, visualized, and passed through machine learning models to make accurate predictions. Regression algorithms such as Linear Regression are evaluated based on performance metrics.

## 📌 Features
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Data Scaling and Transformation
- Feature Engineering (Label Encoding)
- Model Building:
  - Linear Regression
- Model Evaluation using R² Score and Prediction Plots

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 📈 Results
- Built a regression model with R² score evaluation.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset was based on real estate listings in Mumbai, with details such as:
- Area (in square feet)
- Location
- Number of Bedrooms (BHK)
